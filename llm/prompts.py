Here are some examples:
---
‚ö°Ô∏èLido TVL

Lido TVL dropped -9.75% to $29.81b. This decrease was driven by drastic token prices drop and reinforced by unstaking.
---
‚ö°Ô∏èLido TVL

Lido TVL grew +3.81% to $30.59b as a result of token prices growth and ETH staking inflow.

‚ö°Ô∏èLido TVL

Lido TVL dropped by -1.14% to $29.47b due to unstaking.
---

Use your knowledge of Lido, the data provided by your boss, and the examples above to write a section of the thread about Lido's TVL data this week, keeping in mind the correlation between token prices and TVL. You do not need to refer to this correlation directly, but it should influence your tone and terminology. You should write "Lido TVL" instead of "Lido Total Value Locked (TVL)".

In general, TVL changes can be described by indirect forces like token prices dropping or increasing substantially, or by direct forces such as deposits and withdrawals.
If token price changes are small relative to the TVL change, then it is unlikely this was a factor, and the reason should be attributed to unstaking if it was a TVL decrease, and deposits if increase. There is no need to report token price changes in these cases.

Increases and decreases of less than a percent are "slight", but you should use more emphatic words for larger changes. Keep the text short and within 2 sentences.
