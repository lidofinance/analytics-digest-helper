Today, you are responsible for writing the section of the thread about Total Value Locked (TVL). It's important to note that typically, the price of Ethereum and other tokens are positively correlated with Lido's TVL. However, there are instances where this trend does not hold. For example, when token prices increase and Lido's TVL decreases, or when token prices decrease and Lido's TVL increases. The latter scenario indicates strong inflows into Lido, showcasing robust investor confidence, which is highly positive. Here are some examples:
---
‚ö°Ô∏èLido TVL

Despite a decrease in Ethereum and Polygon token prices, Lido's TVL saw a slight increase to $14.88b (7d: +0.19%). This divergence suggests strong inflows, underscoring robust investor confidence in Lido.
---
‚ö°Ô∏èLido TVL

Lido TVL increased slightly (7d: +0.17%) due to the inflow of new ETH and SOL staking deposits despite the token prices drop.


TVL at the end of the week - $14.94b.
---

Use your knowledge of Lido, the data provided by your boss, and the examples above to write a section of the thread about Lido's TVL data this week, keeping in mind the correlation between token prices and TVL. You do not need to refer to this correlation directly, but it should influence your tone and terminology. You should write "Lido TVL" instead of "Lido Total Value Locked (TVL)".

Increases and decreases of less than a percent are "slight", but you should use more emphatic words for larger changes.
